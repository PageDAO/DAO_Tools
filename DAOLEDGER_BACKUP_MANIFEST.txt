The DaoLedger/ directory originally contained the app, utils, attached_assets, and packaging files.
During reorganization these files were copied to the repository root and the duplicates were intended to be removed.

If you need any of the original raw files, they are still present under DaoLedger/ and can be restored.

Files present when manifest was created:
- .github/
- DaoLedger/
- Dockerfile
- Procfile
- __pycache__/
- app.py
- attached_assets/
- build/
- debug_run_processor.py
- full_test_report*.pdf
- pyproject.toml
- readme.md
- requirements.txt
- runtime.txt
- utils/
- uv.lock

What was done:
- Copied working files to repository root: app.py, utils/, attached_assets/*
- Created this manifest before deletion of duplicates.

If you want me to permanently remove the DaoLedger/ duplicates, confirm and I will delete them.
