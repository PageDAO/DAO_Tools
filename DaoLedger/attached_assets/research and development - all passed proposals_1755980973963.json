In the present situation with PageDAO, a sum of roughly 2M $PAGE are unissued and have no immediate plan for issuance. If this proposal is to pass, these tokens will be issued to the ELM DAO Treasury to be managed intelligently so that $PAGE can grow at the speed the market needs it to.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\n$PAGE liquidity needs a great deal of planning and management. As a result, not having a well-defined team and funding structure for intelligent token issuance is costing PageDAO time and energy. The goal of liquidity-targeted token issuance is to ensure that developers and users have access to $PAGE liquidity in the environments where it is needed most. The Ethical Liquidity Management DAO can take on some of the responsibility PageDAO bears for the availability and liquidity of $PAGE, while creating onchain technologies to solve problems for PageDAO and other partner DAOs who need intelligent issuance to keep up with the increasingly rapid pace of innovation across Web3. \n\n## ELM DAO Team & Qualifications\n\nELM DAO is an organization primarily composed of PageDAO’s most tokenomics-oriented Core Team Members and other closely aligned long-term PageDAO Members. There are presently a total of five ELM DAO Members, EpicDylan will serve as Lead Strategist with Cryptoversal and SmartDigitalPayments rounding out the strategy team. Indefatigable and Rionna Morgan will join the project as technical advisors.\n\n### Strategic Leadership\nEpicDylan has been a successful cryptocurrency investor and designer, and his connections ensure that he is able to remain in the loop with respect to PageDAO’s needs. \n\n### Strategy Team\nCryptoversal is a lawyer and web3 book innovator with a breadth of knowledge about Web3. \nSmartDigitalPayments is a successful Web3 entrepreneur with  extensive experience in the specific tokenomics and liquidity management of PageDAO. \n\n### Advisors\nIndefatigable is the Head of Research & Development at PageDAO and brings a master’s level of technical knowledge to the table. \nRionna Morgan is a brilliant legal mind with a powerful approach to building community. \nNFTJoe is the founder of UNDRGRND and a long-time developer and writer and serial networker in the Web3 space. \nCD Damitio is a strong community builder and cryptocurrency/NFT space builder. \n\nTogether, this team can delegate the difficult tasks we face to top-tier talents in the space to efficiently solve problems at scale on behalf of aligned DAOs everywhere, starting with PageDAO and leveraging the true power of $PAGE: the people who believe in it.\n\n## Fee Structure\nThe ELM DAO Fee is 10%, or 200k $PAGE, to be paid out in four installments by Core Team, which will work with ELM DAO to determine goals and to review progress. The initial 50k $PAGE allotment will be staked by ELM DAO to signal that the relationship is in full force, and ELM DAO will agree to provide PageDAO 30 days’ notice before unstaking these tokens. 50k $PAGE will be vested to ELM DAO for 3 months upon successful staking of $PAGE, and ELM DAO wishes to make clear its intentions for these tokens: stake them and leave them staked. Either party may terminate this arrangement and ask ELM DAO to return remaining $PAGE to PageDAO Treasury within this 90-day period or afterward, though compensation can only be revoked before it is awarded. \n\n## Summary\nELM DAO seeks a partnership with PageDAO to legally, fairly, and ethically accelerate the liquidity portion of $PAGE token issuance and target it to identified needs generated by conversation with DAO members and other aligned stakeholders throughout the Web3 space. These activities will be publicly logged by ELM DAO. ELM DAO will accept responsibility for issuing these $PAGE tokens on an asymptotic basis with four gradations as an initial plan, and will commit to in-depth coverage of ongoing events including partnerships, issuances, airdrops, and more; in exclusive partnership with Vagobond Magazine:\n\n1-200k primary gas token pools, 50k Factory pools. Active between 1 and 2M $PAGE balance.\n50k primary gas token pools, 25k Factory pools. Active between 500k and 1M $PAGE balance.\n10k PGT pools, 5k F pools. 250-500k $PAGE balance.\n1k PGT, 500 F pools. $PAGE balance beneath 250k. Re-evaluate when 50k total is reached.\n\n\nAt the conclusion of these four steps of $PAGE token liquidity issuance, $PAGE liquidity will be available across Web3 in enough quantity to support PageDAO dApps on all of the most robust networks.\n\n\nIf approved, this proposal will send 2M $PAGE to ELM DAO and initiate a 200k $PAGE incentive package for that organization from Core Team Treasury.","total_power":"183120593517983","start_height":14672372,"allow_revoting":false,"min_voting_period":null},"createdAt":"2024-04-03T20:30:44.348Z","completedAt":"2024-04-04T21:57:37.000Z","executedAt":"2024-04-04T21:57:37.000Z"},{"coreAddress":"osmo1a40j922z0kwqhw2nn0nx66ycyk88vyzcs73fyjrd092cjgyvyjksrd8dp7","proposalModuleAddress":"osmo1m6s0q7nvu8d2yguqx2luyxc8rr9333ac573h5p2cfyanupt8hn7qg2w2dv","id":28,"proposal":{"msgs":[{"wasm":{"execute":{"msg":"eyJzZXRfaXRlbSI6eyJrZXkiOiJiZXRhVjFNaW50ZXJQbGF0Zm9ybUZlZUJQUyIsInZhbHVlIjoiMTAwIn19","funds":[],"contract_addr":"osmo1a40j922z0kwqhw2nn0nx66ycyk88vyzcs73fyjrd092cjgyvyjksrd8dp7"}}}],"title":"(Beta

Approval of $PAGE Staking Rewards Plan for 2024 and Beyond\n\nSummary \n\nThis proposal seeks approval from the PageDAO community to implement a staking rewards program for members who have staked $PAGE tokens on DAODAO. The plan outlines the issuance rate of $PAGE tokens and the allocation required to fund staking rewards for the remainder of 2024 and the year 2025 and beyond. In addition to this forward-looking component, PageDAO will issue a one-time distribution of 500k $PAGE tokens to reward stakers who have been present for the buildout phase.\n\nBackground \n\nTo incentivize and reward our dedicated community members, we propose introducing a staking rewards process. By staking $PAGE tokens on DAODAO, members contribute to the stability and growth of the PageDAO ecosystem. This staking rewards plan ensures transparency, fairness, and long-term commitment to our members.\n\nStaking Rewards Plan Details Permanent $PAGE Issuance Rate \n\n•\tDaily Issuance Rate: 27,397 $PAGE tokens per day \n\no\tDerivation: Total annual issuance of 10,000,000 $PAGE tokens divided by 365 days (10,000,000 / 365 ≈ 27,397) Staking Rewards for Remainder of 2024 \n\n•\tDays Remaining in 2024: 71 days •\tTotal $PAGE Required for 2024: 1,945,187 $PAGE tokens o\tCalculation: 27,397 $PAGE/day * 71 days ≈ 2M $PAGE \n\n\n\nImplementation Plan\n\nImmediate Activation: Kick off the $PAGE staking rewards on the DAODAO contract (or an equivalent staking solution) as soon as possible.\n\nConsistent Distribution: Distribute staking rewards at the fixed daily rate of 27,397 $PAGE tokens.\n\nFunding Allocation: Allocate 1,999,981 $PAGE tokens to fund the staking rewards for the remainder of 2024.\n\nContinuation into 2025 and Beyond: Maintain the daily issuance rate of 27,397 $PAGE tokens to support the staking rewards program in subsequent years. \n\n\n\nCaveat: Flexibility in Rewards Distribution \n\n•\tAlternative Methods: In the event that the Governance Team discovers, or the Research & Development SubDAO develops, an alternative method for delivering staking rewards, the Team retains the right to modify how the rewards are distributed. Any modification to the rewards distribution method will require approval from eligible voting members through the established voting process.\n\nGovernance / Staking Rewards Team \n\nThe following members will oversee the implementation and management of the staking rewards program: \n\n•\tT. Dylan Daniel \n\n•\tGreg Fishbone \n\n•\tRobbie Pollock \n\n•\tCD Damitio \n\n•\tRionna Morgan \n\n•\tMusashi\n\nBenefits to the Community \n\n•\tIncentivize Participation: Rewards members for their active involvement and commitment to the PageDAO ecosystem. \n\n•\tPromote Long-Term Holding: Encourages members to stake their $PAGE tokens, enhancing token stability and value. \n\n•\tStrengthen the Ecosystem: Fosters a robust and engaged community, essential for the growth and success of PageDAO. \n\n•\tAdaptive and Innovative: Allows for flexibility to adopt improved methods of rewards distribution, ensuring the staking program remains efficient and effective.\n\nVoting Details \n\n•\tEligibility: All staked members of PageDAO are eligible to vote on this proposal. \n\n•\tVoting Period: The voting period will commence on Monday, October 21 and conclude when resolved by vote. \n\n•\tQuorum Requirement: A minimum participation of 20% of staked members is required for the vote to be valid. \n\n•\tApproval Threshold: A simple majority (>50%) of the votes cast is needed for the proposal to pass.\n\nAction Items Upon Approval\n\nTeam Formation: The Governance / Staking Rewards Team (listed above) will oversee the implementation and management of the staking rewards program.\n\nOne-Time Distribution: The proposal, when passed, will distribute 500k $PAGE tokens according to staked balance as a retroactive incentive for participation. \n\nMember Communication: Inform all PageDAO members about the activation of the staking rewards program and provide guidelines on how to participate via Twitter, Discord, Telegram, and other channels.\n\nMonitoring and Reporting: Regularly monitor the program's performance and share updates with the community.\n\nEvaluation of Alternatives: The Governance Team and R&D SubDAO will continually assess potential alternative methods for delivering staking rewards.\n\nModification Process: Any proposed changes to the rewards distribution method will be presented to the community onchain for approval before implementation.\n\nConclusion \n\nImplementing this staking rewards plan is a strategic move to enhance member engagement, promote token stability, and foster the long-term success of PageDAO. By incorporating the flexibility to adopt alternative methods and with the dedicated Governance / Staking Rewards Team in place, we ensure that the program can evolve with the needs of the community and technological advancements. We encourage all eligible members to cast their vote on this proposal.\n\nThank you for your continued dedication to PageDAO. Together, we are shaping the future of decentralized publishing.\n\n\n\nFinal Proposal Meeting: October 21, 2024\n\nTeam Members in Attendance:\n\n•\tT.

We will then lock the outstanding supply of $PAGE into a vesting contract that can only be modified by vote of governance in the main PageDAO [ \n\nhttps://daodao.zone/dao/osmo1a40j922z0kwqhw2nn0nx66ycyk88vyzcs73fyjrd092cjgyvyjksrd8dp7/home ].\n\n\n\nThe structure of the $PAGE token finalization operation will be as follows: the multisig signers who control the smart contract (Epicdylan, indefatigable, philofaustin, & chejazi) will mint the rest of the total $PAGE supply, 60M $PAGE, yielding the total issuance of 100M tokens, and will transfer the balance to an audited, governance-secured vesting contract controlled by PageDAO on Osmosis via DAODAO. Then, the signers will burn the rights to mint new $PAGE by transferring the ADMIN rights to the BURN ADDRESS on Ethereum Mainnet.\n\n\n\nThis will ensure that a majority of $PAGE stakers must approve of any modifications to $PAGE distribution plans and will programmatically disburse new tokens to be allocated by the DAO to the staking rewards pool until such time as the contract there can be considered secure enough to house the entire supply of minted but not circulating tokens. \n\n\n\nThe entire balance of $PAGE in the vesting contract will be allocated to staking rewards. No new $PAGE will ever be minted, creating security and removing the handicap $PAGE has faced relative to other cryptocurrencies previously. \n\n\n\nAs a result of these actions, PageDAO will transition from an organization based around an incomplete tokenomics architecture to a completed token-based onchain ecosystem designed to leverage the power of $PAGE to connect creators, developers, and readers with one another. \n\n\n\nProposed Workflow Steps: \n\nDAODAO proposal 1 - signal intentions [in process] \n\nMultisig transaction 1: mint out $PAGE - 60M new tokens [not started] \n\nMultisig transaction 2: transfer minted $PAGE to Osmosis PageDAO controlled wallet [not started] \n\nMultisig transaction 3: burn $PAGE admin permission [not started] \n\nDAODAO proposal 2: lock $PAGE in vesting contract that distributes them to the main DAODAO wallet at a rate of 2.5M every 90 days (OR distribute them directly to the staking rewards contract every 90 days).
